        Establish the foundational data infrastructure for the system using PostgreSQL with pgvector extension.
        This includes designing and implementing the database schema for storing documents, relationships,
        vector embeddings for RAG, conversation sessions, and document versioning.

        1. As a developer, I need Docker Compose setup so I can run PostgreSQL locally
        2. As a developer, I need database schema designed so documents can be stored hierarchically
        3. As a developer, I need pgvector extension so embeddings can be stored and queried
        4. As a developer, I need migration scripts so schema changes are version-controlled
        5. As a developer, I need SQLAlchemy models so I can interact with database from Python
