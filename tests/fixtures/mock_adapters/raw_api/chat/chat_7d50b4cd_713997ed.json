            "content": "Feature: User Authentication\n\nDescription:\nUser authentication is a crucial feature that allows users to securely access their accounts and protect their personal information. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the system and perform actions within it.\n\nKey Features:\n1. User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their email address, username, and password. They may also be required to verify their email address to complete the registration process.\n\n2. Login: Users can securely log in to their accounts by entering their username and password. The system should authenticate the user's credentials and grant access to the account if they are correct.\n\n3. Password Reset: In case a user forgets their password, they should be able to reset it by providing their email address or answering security questions. A secure password reset process should be in place to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n4. Multi-factor Authentication: To enhance security, users can enable multi-factor authentication, which requires them to provide an additional form of verification, such as a code sent to their phone or email, in addition to their password.\n\n5. Account Lockout: To prevent brute force attacks, the system should have a mechanism in place to lock out an account after multiple failed login attempts. Users should be notified and provided with instructions on how to unlock their account.\n\n6. Session Management: The system should manage user sessions securely, including session timeouts and the ability to log out of the account from any device.\n\n7. User Roles and Permissions: Administrators can assign different roles and permissions to users, controlling their access to certain features and data within the system.\n\n8. Audit Trail: All user authentication and authorization activities should be logged and audited for security and compliance purposes.\n\n9. Password Policy: The system should enforce a strong password policy, including requirements for password complexity, length, and expiration.\n\n10. Secure Communication: All communication between the user and the system should be encrypted to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.\n\nBenefits:\n- Enhanced security: User authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.\n- User control: Users can securely manage their accounts and access the system with confidence.\n- Compliance: User authentication helps organizations comply with security and privacy regulations by ensuring only authorized users can access the system.",
