Implementing dual or triple authorization requirements is crucial for ensuring security and compliance. Time-based holds and conditional approvals add another layer of complexity but are necessary to accommodate different business rules and requirements.\n\nTo address these challenges, you may want to consider implementing a flexible and customizable approval workflow engine within your platform. This engine should allow for the configuration of multiple levels of authorization, time-based holds, and conditional approvals based on specific business rules set by each client. Providing a user-friendly interface for setting up and managing these workflows will also be key to ensuring a smooth user experience for treasury managers and finance controllers.\n\nRegular testing and monitoring of the approval workflows will be essential to ensure that they are functioning correctly and meeting the needs of your clients. Additionally, providing comprehensive training and support to users on how to navigate and utilize the approval workflows effectively will be crucial for successful adoption of the platform.\n\nOverall, by carefully designing and implementing a robust approval workflow system that can handle the complexities of high-value transactions and varying client requirements, you can ensure that your commercial banking platform meets the needs of your target users and provides a secure and efficient payment origination process.",
