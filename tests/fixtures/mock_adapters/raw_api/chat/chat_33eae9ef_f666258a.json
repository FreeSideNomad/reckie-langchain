Identify document types: Start by identifying the different types of documents that each persona typically creates. For example, a Business Analyst may create requirements documents, a Product Owner may create product roadmaps, and a QA Lead may create test plans.\n\n2. Develop context-aware questions: Create a set of context-aware questions for each document type that guide the user through the document creation process. These questions should prompt the user to provide relevant information and ensure that the document is comprehensive and well-structured.\n\n3. Integrate AI capabilities: Integrate AI capabilities such as natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the user's responses to the questions and provide real-time feedback and suggestions. This can help improve the quality and accuracy of the documents being created.\n\n4. Design user interfaces: Design user interfaces tailored to each persona that present the context-aware questions in a clear and intuitive manner. Consider incorporating features such as auto-complete, spell check, and document templates to further assist users in creating documents.\n\n5. Implement collaboration features: Enable collaboration features that allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, share feedback, and track changes. This can facilitate communication and coordination among team members during the document creation process.\n\n6. Test with users: Conduct user testing with representatives from each persona to gather feedback on the system's usability, effectiveness, and overall user experience. Use this feedback to make improvements and refinements to the system.\n\n7. Deploy and iterate: Deploy the document management system with AI assistance in a production environment and monitor its usage and performance. Continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the system to address any issues and enhance its capabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a document management system with AI assistance that guides Business Analysts, Product Owners, and QA Leads through the process of creating different document types with context-aware questions, improving efficiency and collaboration within the organization.",
