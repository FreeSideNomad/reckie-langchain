  prompt: What are the benefits of testing without API costs?
  response: '1. Cost savings: By testing without API costs, companies can save money
    on expensive API usage fees, especially for high-volume testing or large-scale
    projects.


    2. Flexibility: Without API costs, companies have the flexibility to run tests
    as frequently as needed without worrying about exceeding budget constraints.


    3. Faster development cycles: Testing without API costs allows for quicker iterations
    and faster development cycles, as teams can test more frequently without incurring
    additional expenses.


    4. Improved quality: With the ability to test more frequently and thoroughly without
    API costs, companies can ensure higher quality software and catch bugs earlier
    in the development process.


    5. Increased innovation: Without the constraints of API costs, teams can experiment
    with new ideas and technologies more freely, leading to increased innovation and
    creativity in their projects.'
