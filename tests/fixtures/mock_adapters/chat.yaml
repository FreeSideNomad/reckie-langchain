    efficient and secure transactions. I'm sure this platform will be a valuable tool
    for businesses looking to manage their finances effectively. Good luck with the
    development process! The main challenge is the complex approval workflows. We
    need dual authorization for payments over $100K, and some clients need triple
    authorization. The system must also handle time-based holds and conditional approvals
    based on business rules.
  response: 'Managing complex approval workflows can indeed be a challenge, especially
    when dealing with high-value transactions like those over $100K. Implementing
    dual or triple authorization requirements is crucial for ensuring security and
    compliance. Time-based holds and conditional approvals add another layer of complexity
    but are necessary to accommodate different business rules and requirements.


    To address these challenges, you may want to consider implementing a flexible
    and customizable approval workflow engine within your platform. This engine should
    allow for the configuration of multiple levels of authorization, time-based holds,
    and conditional approvals based on specific business rules set by each client.
    Providing a user-friendly interface for setting up and managing these workflows
    will also be key to ensuring a smooth user experience for treasury managers and
    finance controllers.


    Regular testing and monitoring of the approval workflows will be essential to
    ensure that they are functioning correctly and meeting the needs of your clients.
    Additionally, providing comprehensive training and support to users on how to
    navigate and utilize the approval workflows effectively will be crucial for successful
    adoption of the platform.


    Overall, by carefully designing and implementing a robust approval workflow system
    that can handle the complexities of high-value transactions and varying client
    requirements, you can ensure that your commercial banking platform meets the needs
    of your target users and provides a secure and efficient payment origination process.'

  response: 'The testing pyramid is a concept that categorizes software tests into
    three layers based on their scope and speed of execution. The pyramid consists
    of three layers:


    1. Unit tests: These tests focus on testing individual components or units of
    code in isolation. Unit tests are typically fast to execute and provide quick
    feedback on the correctness of the code. They form the base of the testing pyramid
    and should make up the majority of your test suite.


    2. Integration tests: These tests verify the interactions between different components
    or modules of the system. Integration tests ensure that the integrated components
    work together correctly and can communicate effectively. They are slower to execute
    than unit tests but provide valuable insights into the system''s behavior.


    3. End-to-end tests: These tests validate the system as a whole by testing the
    entire application from the user''s perspective. End-to-end tests simulate real
    user interactions and test the system''s functionality across multiple components.
    They are the slowest to execute but provide the highest level of confidence in
    the system''s behavior.


    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development
    practice that involves automating the process of integrating code changes, running
    tests, and deploying the application to production. CI/CD pipelines automate the
    build, test, and deployment processes, enabling teams to deliver software faster
    and more reliably.


    Coverage targets refer to the percentage of code that is covered by automated
    tests. Code coverage metrics, such as line coverage, branch coverage, and function
    coverage, measure the effectiveness of your test suite in exercising different
    parts of the codebase. Setting coverage targets helps ensure that critical parts
    of the code are adequately tested and that the test suite provides sufficient
    confidence in the system''s behavior.


    Incorporating the testing pyramid, CI/CD practices, and coverage targets into
    your testing strategy can help you achieve a balance between speed, coverage,
    and reliability in testing your document management system. By focusing on unit
    tests for fast feedback, integrating tests for system interactions, and end-to-end
    tests for user scenarios, you can ensure comprehensive test coverage while leveraging
    automation to streamline the testing process. Continuous integration and deployment
    practices can help you deliver changes quickly and reliably, while setting coverage

  prompt: Create feature document for user authentication
  response: 'Feature: User Authentication


    Description:

    User authentication is a crucial feature that allows users to securely access
    their accounts and protect their personal information. This feature ensures that
    only authorized users can access the system and perform actions within it.


    Key Features:

    1. User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their email address,
    username, and password. They may also be required to verify their email address
    to complete the registration process.


    2. Login: Users can securely log in to their accounts by entering their username
    and password. The system should authenticate the user''s credentials and grant
    access to the account if they are correct.


    3. Password Reset: In case a user forgets their password, they should be able
    to reset it by providing their email address or answering security questions.
    A secure password reset process should be in place to prevent unauthorized access.


    4. Multi-factor Authentication: To enhance security, users can enable multi-factor
    authentication, which requires them to provide an additional form of verification,
    such as a code sent to their phone or email, in addition to their password.


    5. Account Lockout: To prevent brute force attacks, the system should have a mechanism
    in place to lock out an account after multiple failed login attempts. Users should
    be notified and provided with instructions on how to unlock their account.


    6. Session Management: The system should manage user sessions securely, including
    session timeouts and the ability to log out of the account from any device.


    7. User Roles and Permissions: Administrators can assign different roles and permissions
    to users, controlling their access to certain features and data within the system.


    8. Audit Trail: All user authentication and authorization activities should be
    logged and audited for security and compliance purposes.


    9. Password Policy: The system should enforce a strong password policy, including
    requirements for password complexity, length, and expiration.


    10. Secure Communication: All communication between the user and the system should
    be encrypted to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.


    Benefits:

    - Enhanced security: User authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to
    user accounts and sensitive information.

    - User control: Users can securely manage their accounts and access the system
