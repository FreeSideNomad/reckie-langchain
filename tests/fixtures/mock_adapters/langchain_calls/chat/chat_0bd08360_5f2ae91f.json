Multiple personas: Business Analyst, Product Owner, QA Lead. AI guides them through creating different document types with context-aware questions. To create a document management system with AI assistance that caters to multiple personas such as a Business Analyst, Product Owner, and QA Lead, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify document types: Start by identifying the different types of documents that each persona typically creates. For example, a Business Analyst may create requirements documents, a Product Owner may create product roadmaps, and a QA Lead may create test plans.\n\n2. Develop context-aware questions: Create a set of context-aware questions for each document type that guide the user through the document creation process. These questions should prompt the user to provide relevant information and ensure that the document is comprehensive and well-structured.\n\n3. Integrate AI capabilities: Integrate AI capabilities such as natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the user's responses to the questions and provide real-time feedback and suggestions. This can help improve the quality and accuracy of the documents being created.\n\n4. Design user interfaces: Design user interfaces tailored to each persona that present the context-aware questions in a clear and intuitive manner. Consider incorporating features such as auto-complete, spell check, and document templates to further assist users in creating documents.\n\n5. Implement collaboration features: Enable collaboration features that allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, share feedback, and track changes. This can facilitate communication and coordination among team members during the document creation process.\n\n6. Test with users: Conduct user testing with representatives from each persona to gather feedback on the system's usability, effectiveness, and overall user experience. Use this feedback to make improvements and refinements to the system.\n\n7. Deploy and iterate: Deploy the document management system with AI assistance in a production environment and monitor its usage and performance. Continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the system to address any issues and enhance its capabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a document management system with AI assistance that guides Business Analysts, Product Owners, and QA Leads through the process of creating different document types with context-aware questions, improving efficiency and collaboration within the organization. Uses RAG for retrieving parent document context. Documents have parent-child relationships like Vision \u2192 Features \u2192 Epics \u2192 User Stories. To incorporate the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status for retrieving parent document context in a document management system with parent-child relationships like Vision \u2192 Features \u2192 Epics \u2192 User Stories, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the parent-child relationships: Clearly define the hierarchy of documents in your system, such as Vision being the parent document, Features being the child of Vision, Epics being the child of Features, and User Stories being the child of Epics.\n\n2. Implement RAG status: Assign a RAG status (Red, Amber, Green) to each document in the hierarchy based on its current status or progress. This status can indicate whether the document is on track (Green), requires attention (Amber), or is at risk (Red).\n\n3. Retrieve parent document context: When a user is working on a child document (e.g., User Story), use the RAG status of the parent documents (e.g., Epics, Features, Vision) to provide context and highlight any potential issues or risks. This can help users understand the overall status of the project and make informed decisions.\n\n4. Display parent document information: Display relevant information from the parent documents, such as goals, objectives, dependencies, and risks, to provide additional context for the child document. This can help users understand how their work aligns with the broader project goals and priorities.\n\n5. Use AI for context-aware suggestions: Utilize AI capabilities to analyze the RAG status and content of the parent documents and provide context-aware suggestions for improving the child document. For example, AI could recommend specific actions or changes based on the status of the parent documents.\n\n6. Enable collaboration and feedback: Allow users to collaborate on documents, provide feedback, and track changes across the parent-child hierarchy. This can facilitate communication and coordination among team members and ensure that everyone is aligned on the project status and goals.\n\nBy incorporating the RAG status for retrieving parent document context in a document management system with parent-child relationships, you can enhance visibility, alignment, and decision-making within the organization, ultimately improving project outcomes and efficiency. Combine feature 3 and 4 into one feature To combine the retrieval of parent document context based on RAG status and the display of parent document information into one feature in a document management system with parent-child relationships, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the feature requirements: Clearly define the requirements for the combined feature, including the ability to retrieve parent document context based on RAG status and display relevant information from parent documents to provide context for the child document.\n\n2. Implement RAG status retrieval: Develop functionality to retrieve the RAG status of parent documents in the hierarchy when a user is working on a child document. This can involve analyzing the status of each parent document (e.g., Vision, Features, Epics) and determining the overall project status based on the RAG statuses.\n\n3. Display parent document information: Integrate the display of relevant information from parent documents, such as goals, objectives, dependencies, and risks, within the child document interface. This information should provide context for the user and help them understand how their work aligns with the broader project goals and priorities.\n\n4. Use AI for context-aware suggestions: Utilize AI capabilities to analyze the RAG status and content of parent documents and provide context-aware suggestions for improving the child document. AI can recommend specific actions or changes based on the status of the parent documents to help users make informed decisions.\n\n5. Enable collaboration and feedback: Allow users to collaborate on documents, provide feedback, and track changes across the parent-child hierarchy within the combined feature. This feature should facilitate communication and coordination among team members and ensure alignment on project status and goals.\n\nBy combining the retrieval of parent document context based on RAG status and the display of parent document information into one feature, you can provide users with a comprehensive view of the project status and context within the document management system. This integrated feature can enhance visibility, alignment, and decision-making, ultimately improving project outcomes and efficiency. add a feature for export to PDF",
